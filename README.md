# Iterate Conference Schedule App

## Color schemes and typography
Iterate blue is used as the main color. Derivatives from this can be found on
[Colorhexa][].

The [Ubuntu][] face is used for both titles and paragraph text.

## Dependencies and developing
Client side, this project is using [VanillaJS][].
You can use the latest and greatest from ES6, including modules, thanks to
transpiling.

Enter [Grunt][]. It is used to build the app and has alot of other utilities
built in as well.  
Go ahead and install it globally using `npm install -g grunt-cli`.

Run `npm install` in the project root to download the rest of the needed
dependencies.

For CSS, the grid and reset are borrowed from the [Foundation framework][].
Other than that -- you're on your own.

Run `grunt server` to start developing!

## Deploy
Running with Harp on konferanse.app.iterate.no

```shell
$ git remote add iterate dokku@app.iterate.no:konferanse
$ git push iterate master
```

## Updating the conference program
The program is scraped from a Google Spreadsheet using this command:

    npm run-script update-schedule

The result is injected into `app/index.html`.
See `bin/update-schedule.js` on how that works.


## Old Conference Schedules
Old conference programs are kept at subdirectories in `www/`, e.g. `www/2014w`
is the place to look for the 2014 Iterate Conference Winter Edition.
